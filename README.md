Revature Project 0 - Individual Business Problem with Java 8 on Console

This project was an individual assignment for me to complete. It is an inventory management system designed to emulate a library system that fit the context of a business solution. As an application, you can check in/out, add and remove books from a persistant SQL database table. As an initial project, all output is delivered through the IDE console, of which IntelliJ was my personal choice.
